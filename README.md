# PHASE-3-PROJECT
SyriaTelCustomerChurn
Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict customer churn — whether a customer will stop doing business with the company.
Customer churn represents a significant financial risk, as acquiring new customers is more costly than retaining existing ones. This project aims to enable proactive retention strategies through predictive analytics.
Business Problem
The company experiences customer attrition that impacts revenue and long-term growth.
Objective
Build and evaluate classification models that accurately predict churn, allowing the business to:
Identify high-risk customers
Improve retention strategies
Reduce revenue loss
Optimize marketing spend
The project follows a structured data science lifecycle:
Data Science Methodology
1. Business Understanding
Defined churn prediction objective and success metrics.
2. Data Collection
Imported and reviewed customer behavioral dataset.
3. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handled missing values
Encoded categorical variables
Scaled numerical features (where necessary)
Split data into training and testing sets
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Examined churn distribution
Analyzed key drivers (e.g., service usage, customer service calls)
Identified class imbalance
5. Modeling
Models implemented:
Logistic Regression (baseline, interpretable)
Decision Tree (non-linear relationships)
6. Model Evaluation
Evaluation metrics used:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
ROC-AUC
