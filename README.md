# PHASE-3-PROJECT
SyriaTelCustomerChurn
This project develops a machine learning model to predict customer churn — whether a customer will stop doing business with the company.

Customer churn represents a significant financial risk, as acquiring new customers is more costly than retaining existing ones. This project aims to enable proactive retention strategies through predictive analytics.
Business Problem

The company experiences customer attrition that impacts revenue and long-term growth.

Objective
Build and evaluate classification models that accurately predict churn, allowing the business to:

Identify high-risk customers

Improve retention strategies

Reduce revenue loss

Optimize marketing spend
